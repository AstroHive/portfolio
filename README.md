꧁Undergraduate Astronomy Student꧂

#### I. Who am I?
     My name is Nicholas and I am a undergraduate astronomy college student. I am completing my studies at American Public University so that I may get a Bachelor of Science degree in Space Studies within the Astronomy concentration. My biggest academic goal is to achieve a PhD in an astronomy or astrophysics. I used to attend the University of Phoenix for a B.S. in Computer Science but decided to change my major. Unfortunately, UoPhoenix did not offer an astronomy based program. I will post astronomy, computer science, and gaming related content on TikTok nearly everyday and weekly on Sunday on YouTube.
